    "1.  **Q1: Product Selection & Data Collection:** Rationale for selection and loading of product data.\n",
    "2.  **Q2: Analysis with LLM:** Using OpenAI's GPT models to extract visual features, product specifications, sentiment, and an image generation prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To ensure reproducibility without requiring live web scraping, this notebook generates the necessary dataset (reviews and description) locally before processing."
