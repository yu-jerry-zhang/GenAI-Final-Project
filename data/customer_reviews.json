    "review_body": "This keyboard is a masterpiece. The colors perfectly match my old NES console-that specific creamy grey and the bold red letters. The 'Super Buttons' are comically large but actually super useful for macros. The clicky switches sound like 80s computing bliss."

    "review_body": "Visually, it's a 10/10. The power LED looks just like the one on the original console. The plastic feels thick and retro. My only gripe is the software to map the keys is a bit clunky, but I mostly bought it for the aesthetic anyway."

    "review_body": "I love the attention to detail. The volume knob has a satisfying click. It doesn't have RGB lighting, which is perfect because that would ruin the retro vibe. The grey and white color scheme is spot on."

    "review_body": "It looks amazing on my desk, very clean and boxy design. However, the 'clicky' switches are very loud. If you work in a quiet office, people will hate you. But if you want that retro clack, this is it."
